# python keylogger

very basic keylogger built using the pynput module.

## getting started

really only needs the path of where you want to save the keylog.txt file.
again, this is very simple and just saves keystrokes while running.

pynput: [here is the documentation](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
